    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>I'm Jordan Brazier, my student number and email are s3979972 and s3979972@student.rmit.edu.au. I'm Australian with Danish heritage, I graduated Year 12 in 2021 with a Certificate III in information, digital media and technology. I am passionate about cooking, and aside from that my favourite pasttimes are playing with Pablo, my pet blue tongue lizard, and working on my computer.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p> I have an interest in creating websites and experience in coding languages such as PHP, HTML and SQL as well as building and working on electronics like desktop computers, laptops and mobile phones. My passion for electronics and software started as far back as I can remember when I got my first computer and started modding games like Minecraft and Skyrim. I attribute my interest in website development to my dad, when I was a kid, he would go through what he was trying to do while I would watch him building and debugging his own websites.</p>
    <p> I chose to study at RMIT because they are a respected, leading university recognized for innovation in technology and design. I feel as though RMIT would give me the best education and chance at success in the IT industry by studying and learning under experts in this field with access to state of the art facilities.</p>
    <p> I am still not entirely sure of what I want to study during my time at RMIT, however, currently I hope to gain industry-leading knowledge in cyber-security, website development, networking and artificial intelligence, and to grow my communication and teamwork skills by working productively in teams and groups of likeminded peers.</p>
